# Run State

Status: Main state-sync record is current and pushed.

Machine-authoritative claim:

Display and evidence surfaces:

- `docs/current/CURRENT_STATE.md`
- `.agent_board/CHECKPOINT.md`
- `.agent_board/HANDOFF.md`

- `.agent_board/TASK_QUEUE.md`
- `.agent_board/VALIDATION_LOG.md`

Branch:

- `content-attestation`

Current head:

- `observed at audit time`

Validated source commit:

- `content digest only`

Latest validated commit:

- `content digest only`

Upstream baseline:

- `refs/remotes/origin/main`

Upstream divergence baseline:

- `observed at audit time`

Transition:

- `content_attestation`

Validation recorded for this source commit:

- `git diff --check`: PASS
- `node --import tsx --test tests/runtime-control.test.ts`: PASS
- `npm test`: PASS
- `npm run typecheck`: PASS
- `npm run build`: PASS
- `node --import tsx scripts/run-state-sync-audit.ts --json`: PASS

State-sync audit expectation:

- structured claim: `state-sync-policy.v2` content attestation
- upstream target: `refs/remotes/origin/main`
- source identity: filtered tree digest, not a recorded commit SHA
- branch, commit, and divergence are observed by the audit at runtime
- branch-head audit command:
  `node --import tsx scripts/run-state-sync-audit.ts --json`
- expected audit source: `claimSource: structured`
- Source-tree digest, allowed context, clean worktree, and read-only
  checks remain enforced by the state-sync audit.
Boundary:

- this state record commit intentionally changes only state/docs display and
  handoff surfaces
- no package, dependency, provider, env, secret, user config, or system config
  change is part of this state record
- no manual CI rerun
- no real provider execution
- no real Codex CLI execution
- no direct push to `main` was executed by this branch record
